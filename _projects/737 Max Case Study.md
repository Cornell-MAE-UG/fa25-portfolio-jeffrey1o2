**Introduction**

Big decisions are the result of a culmination of smaller ones. While engineering is often viewed as objective, being guided by algorithms and systems, the Boeing 737 MAX case demonstrates that ethical decision-making plays a decisive role in determining whether technology ultimately helps or hurts the public.

While our course emphasized the various considerations and viewpoints on "ethics" and its influence on decision-making, this blog synthesizes my ideas throughout the semester and applies them to the 737 MAX case study. I analyzed how ethical failures contributed to the design, certification, and deployment of the 737 MAX, and more specifically, its new Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).

**Identifying Ethical Issues**

The first step in ethical analysis is recognizing that a problem exists. Early in the semester, we framed Boeing's ethical issues as problems rather than conclusions. These included whether Boeing should have been allowed to self-certify critical safety systems, whether engineers were pressured to prioritze schedule and competition over safety, and whether pilots were given sufficient information and training regarding MCAS behavior.

These questions, or issues, spanned across different levels of responsibility, from individual engineers, to corporate leadership, to regulatory bodies. This reinforced a core lesson of 4300: ethical failures are rarely the result of a single bad actor. By narrowing my focus to the most consequential issues, I was able to prioritze safety, transparency, and accountability as central ethical concerns in this case.

**Facts and Assumptions**

We cannot judge the ethics of the 737 MAX case without understanding the facts and assumptions. There were three major categories for facts relevant to the case: technical, individual, and organizational. On the technical side, MCAS relied on input from a single angle-of-attack sensor, could repeatedly command nose-down trim, and was not fully disclosed in pilot training materials. These design decisions created a system with a single point of failure. This is a big no-no, especially in aviation where having redudant systems is the standard. At the individual level, evidence showed that engineers raised concerns initially, but executives emphasized cost and certification speed in order to expedite production and profit. As for the organizational level, Boeing had operated with a highly competitive mindset against Airbus, especially following leadership changes after acquiring McDonnell Douglas. Examining these layers together made it clear that technical flaws were interwoven with managerial decisions.

It is also important to note the assumptions the common person makes, and I applied, when understanding the 737 MAX case. First, while we do not know exactly how concerns regarding MCAS were communicated up the managemnet chain, it is reasonable to assume that safety objections were deprioritized relative to schedule and cost pressures. Similarly, I assume that greater pilot training and clearer system documentation would have improved pilots' ability to respond to MCAS failures.

**Applying Ethical Frameworks**

Using professional codes from ASME, ASCE, and ASEE, I evaluated how ethical principles applied to specific decisions in the 737 MAX program. There was a recurring conflict between loyalty to employrs and the obligation to protect public safety. Ethical canons consistently place public welfare above corportate interests, especially in application where safety is critical. Applying a hierarchy of principles also clarified that engineers should not approve systems with known single points of failure, regardless of organizational pressure. Again, this goes to show there was no single bad actor.

**Contraints and Prevention**

In the final stages of the course, I examined practical constraints that limited ethical decision-making. This included job security concerns, regulatory ambiguity, information silos, and organizational culuture. While these contrains do not excuse ethical failure, they explain how the average Joe who may not mean harm can become complicit in harmful outcomes.

I also explored prevention strategies at multiple levels. Individually, engineers need stronger ethical training and clearer escalation methods. Organziationally, companies must establish independent safety review boards that are unaffected by company pressures. Systemically, regulators should limit self-certification for safety-critical systems. These measures reinforce the idea that ethical engineering requires structural support in addition to individual integrity.

**Conclusion**

The Boeing 737 MAX case reshaped how I understand engineering responsibility. Technical competence alone is insufficient when engineers operate within complex systems shaped by incentives, hierarchies, and regulatory frameworks. Ethical decision-making requires engineers to challenge authority when necessary, and prioritize public safety at all times, even when it is costly or not the norm. As I move forward in my engineering career, the lessons from this course will guide how I evaluate risk, communicate concerns, and live as a more ethical engineer.
